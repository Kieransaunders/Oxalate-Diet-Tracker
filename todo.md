# üö® URGENT: APPLE APP STORE COMPLIANCE - MEDICAL TERMS AUDIT

## CRITICAL FINDINGS - MEDICAL TERMS DETECTED IN APP

**Risk Level**: HIGH - These terms could lead to App Store rejection

### FILES WITH MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY:

1. **userPreferencesStore.ts** - CRITICAL
   - `MedicalCondition` type and references
   - "kidney-stones", "hyperoxaluria" conditions
   - "kidney stone prevention" messaging
   - "medical-grade advice" text
   - "healthcare providers" references

2. **chat-oracle-api.ts** - HIGH RISK
   - "kidney stones", "symptoms", "prevention"
   - Medical advice phrasing in Oracle responses
   - Health condition references

3. **APP_STORE_SETUP.md** - DOCUMENTATION RISK
   - "Medical" category classification
   - "kidney stone prevention" in descriptions
   - "healthcare providers" mentions

4. **MealTracker.tsx** - UI RISK
   - "kidney stone prevention" in user-facing text

5. **OxalateTableScreen.tsx** - UI RISK
   - "kidney stone prevention" in tips

6. **SettingsScreen.tsx** - SOME RISK
   - Medical disclaimer (acceptable if properly framed)

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

## üî• CRITICAL UI FIXES - MOBILE AUDIT RESULTS

**URGENT: The following terms were found in the live app UI and MUST be changed immediately:**

### **Main Foods Screen Issues:**
1. **"Well within safe zone"** ‚Üí Change to **"Within daily target"**
   - File: Look for progress/tracker components
   - Risk: Implies medical safety assessment

2. **"Use Sparingly" badges** ‚Üí Change to **"Higher content"**
   - File: Food recommendation system
   - Risk: Medical advisory language

3. **"Avoid" badges** ‚Üí Change to **"Very high content"**
   - File: Food recommendation system  
   - Risk: Medical dietary restrictions

### **STEP-BY-STEP FIX INSTRUCTIONS:**

**Priority 1 - URGENT UI Text Changes:**
- [ ] Find "Well within safe zone" text and replace with "Within daily target"
- [ ] Replace "Use Sparingly" ‚Üí "Higher content" in food recommendations
- [ ] Replace "Avoid" ‚Üí "Very high content" in food recommendations
- [ ] Replace "kidney stone prevention" ‚Üí "dietary tracking" (found in multiple files)
- [ ] Replace "medical condition" ‚Üí "dietary preference"
- [ ] Replace "healthcare providers" ‚Üí "nutrition professionals"

**Priority 2 - Critical Code Structure:**
- [ ] **userPreferencesStore.ts**: Rename `MedicalCondition` type ‚Üí `DietaryReason`
- [ ] **userPreferencesStore.ts**: Change condition values:
  - "kidney-stones" ‚Üí "low-oxalate-preference"
  - "hyperoxaluria" ‚Üí "very-low-oxalate-preference"
- [ ] **chat-oracle-api.ts**: Remove medical questions like:
  - "How do oxalates form kidney stones?"
  - "What are symptoms of high oxalate intake?"
  - "Can I reverse kidney stone formation?"
- [ ] **MealTracker.tsx**: Remove "kidney stone prevention" text
- [ ] **OxalateTableScreen.tsx**: Remove "kidney stone prevention" text

**Priority 3 - App Store Materials:**
- [ ] **APP_STORE_SETUP.md**: Remove "Medical" category
- [ ] **APP_STORE_SETUP.md**: Remove "kidney stone prevention" from descriptions
- [ ] **APP_STORE_SETUP.md**: Reframe all as nutrition/diet tracking
- [ ] **PRODUCTION_SETUP.md**: Update category from "Health & Fitness" to "Food & Drink"

**Priority 4 - System Prompts & AI:**
- [ ] Update all Oracle system prompts to avoid medical language
- [ ] Remove references to "kidney stone prevention"
- [ ] Frame advice as nutritional information only
- [ ] Add disclaimers about consulting nutrition professionals

### **SAFE REPLACEMENT LANGUAGE:**

| ‚ùå **AVOID** | ‚úÖ **USE INSTEAD** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Medical condition" | "Dietary preference" |
| "Kidney stone prevention" | "Dietary tracking" |
| "Healthcare providers" | "Nutrition professionals" |
| "Use sparingly" | "Higher content" |
| "Avoid" | "Very high content" |
| "Safe zone" | "Daily target" |
| "Symptoms" | "Dietary considerations" |
| "Treatment" | "Dietary approach" |
| "Prevention" | "Management" |
| "Medical advice" | "Nutritional information" |

### **FILES TO UPDATE IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **src/state/userPreferencesStore.ts** - CRITICAL
2. **src/api/chat-oracle-api.ts** - HIGH RISK  
3. **src/components/MealTracker.tsx** - UI RISK
4. **src/screens/OxalateTableScreen.tsx** - UI RISK
5. **APP_STORE_SETUP.md** - STORE RISK
6. **PRODUCTION_SETUP.md** - STORE RISK

# Legal Danger Mitigation Todo List

## 1. Top Goal Selection (‚ÄúFollowing low-oxalate lifestyle / General wellness goals / Other dietary reason‚Äù)

**Risk**: ‚ÄúLow-oxalate lifestyle‚Äù directly links to a medical condition (kidney stones, hyperoxaluria).
**Safer Option**: Keep ‚Äúlow-oxalate‚Äù but frame it as a personal nutrition preference. Add context that it‚Äôs user-defined and for general dietary tracking.
**Example Rewrite**:
* ‚ÄúTracking oxalate intake‚Äù (no mention of prevention/treatment)

---

## 2. Oracle Personality (AI Coach Options)

**Risk**: Current descriptions could be interpreted as medical advice. ‚ÄúConsulting healthcare providers‚Äù is fine, but ‚Äúbalancing health goals‚Äù sounds prescriptive.
**Safer Option**: Make them all clearly informational and educational.
**Example Rewrite**:
* Cautious Companion ‚Äì ‚ÄúShares conservative nutrition information and encourages checking reliable sources.‚Äù
* Balanced Guide ‚Äì ‚ÄúOffers balanced nutritional tips based on your tracking data.‚Äù
* Flexible Coach ‚Äì ‚ÄúProvides friendly, motivational ideas for exploring different foods.‚Äù

---

## 3. App Preferences (High Oxalate Warnings / Personalized Tips)

**Risk**: ‚ÄúWarnings‚Äù can imply a medical hazard; ‚ÄúPersonalized Tips‚Äù might imply tailored treatment.
**Safer Option**: Change ‚ÄúWarnings‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúIndicators‚Äù and clarify that tips are general.
**Example Rewrite**:
* ‚ÄúHigh Oxalate Indicators ‚Äì Show icons for foods with higher oxalate content.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúGeneral Tips ‚Äì Get suggestions based on your selected diet type.‚Äù

---

## 4. Extra Risk Reduction Tactics
* Add a persistent disclaimer in the Settings footer:
‚ÄúThis app provides nutrition information for general educational use only. It is not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult a qualified professional for health-related decisions.‚Äù
* Keep the ‚ÄúOracle‚Äù persona names playful but avoid health outcome promises.
* Move anything that might be construed as a ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù or ‚Äútreatment recommendation‚Äù into optional educational content, clearly labelled as such.
