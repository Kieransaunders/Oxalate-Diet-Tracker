- [ ] **Short-term Task: Stabilize OracleScreen**
  - [ ] Replace all remaining NativeWind `Pressable` components within `OracleScreen.tsx` with standard `Pressable` components to prevent the same crash from happening with other buttons on the screen.

- [ ] **Long-term Task: Research NativeWind `Pressable` Issue**
  - [ ] Investigate why the NativeWind `Pressable` component causes a navigation context error inside a `Modal`. This could be a bug in NativeWind or an incompatibility with another library.
  - [ ] Research for a long-term solution that allows the use of NativeWind components throughout the app without causing crashes. This will allow for more consistent and maintainable styling.
  - [ ] Based on the research, create a plan to either fix the issue, find a workaround, or choose an alternative styling solution.
