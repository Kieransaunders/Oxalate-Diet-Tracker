## Expected Results

✅ All navigation actions should work smoothly without errors
✅ Settings should open as a modal, not push to stack
✅ Tab navigation should be the primary navigation method
✅ HomeScreen should integrate properly with the new navigation system
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors in the navigation code

## Test Status: ✅ PASSED

The HomeScreen has been successfully updated to:
- Use React Navigation hooks directly instead of callback props
- Navigate to tabs using `navigation.navigate()` for tab routes
- Navigate to Settings modal using `rootNavigation.navigate('Settings')`
- Display correct data from the meal store
- Work seamlessly within the new tab-based navigation system
