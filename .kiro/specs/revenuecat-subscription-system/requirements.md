# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing and testing a comprehensive RevenueCat subscription system for the Oxalate Diet Tracker app. The system will provide premium features through monthly and yearly subscription tiers, with proper usage limits for free users and unlimited access for premium subscribers.

## Requirements

3. WHEN running in development mode THEN RevenueCat SHALL use debug logging for troubleshooting
4. IF the API keys are not configured THEN the app SHALL run in demo mode with free tier limits
5. WHEN the app is in testing mode THEN premium features SHALL be unlocked for testers and App Store reviewers

### Requirement 2: Subscription Product Management

### Requirement 3: Usage Limits and Premium Gates

6. WHEN limits reset (daily/monthly) THEN the counters SHALL automatically reset to allow continued usage

### Requirement 4: Purchase Flow and Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase subscriptions securely and restore my purchases on new devices, so that I don't lose access to premium features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 6: Premium Feature Integration

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want unlimited access to all app features, so that I can use the app without restrictions.

5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the subscription system, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.
