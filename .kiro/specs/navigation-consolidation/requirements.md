# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The app currently has navigation issues stemming from an old architecture where the food screen was the home screen. A new home screen has been added, but the navigation system needs to be consolidated and cleaned up. There are duplicate navigation implementations, inconsistent screen handling, and references to non-existent screens that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and intuitive navigation experience so that I can easily move between different sections of the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display the HomeScreen as the initial screen
2. WHEN navigating between main sections THEN the system SHALL use a consistent navigation pattern
3. WHEN using navigation controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback and smooth transitions
4. WHEN accessing any screen THEN the system SHALL maintain proper navigation state and allow users to return to previous screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, well-organized navigation system so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the navigation code THEN the system SHALL have only one primary navigation implementation
2. WHEN adding new screens THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent pattern for screen registration and routing
3. WHEN screens are referenced THEN the system SHALL only reference screens that actually exist
4. WHEN navigation types are defined THEN the system SHALL have accurate TypeScript definitions that match the actual implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want modal screens (like settings and detailed views) to behave consistently so that I understand how to interact with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening modal screens THEN the system SHALL present them with appropriate modal behavior
2. WHEN closing modal screens THEN the system SHALL return to the previous screen state
3. WHEN modal screens have close buttons THEN the system SHALL handle the close action consistently
4. WHEN modal screens are opened from different contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain proper navigation context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main navigation tabs to be easily accessible so that I can quickly switch between primary app functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any main screen THEN the system SHALL display bottom navigation tabs
2. WHEN tapping a tab THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen immediately
3. WHEN on a tab screen THEN the system SHALL highlight the active tab clearly
4. WHEN switching tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of previously visited tabs where appropriate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want screens that are designed as components to work properly within the navigation system so that all features function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are used as screens THEN the system SHALL properly handle their props and navigation context
2. WHEN modal components are integrated THEN the system SHALL manage their visibility and lifecycle correctly
3. WHEN screen components need navigation functions THEN the system SHALL provide proper navigation props
4. WHEN components have different usage modes THEN the system SHALL handle both modal and full-screen presentations appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove duplicate and unused navigation code so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing navigation files THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate navigation implementations
2. WHEN screens are defined THEN the system SHALL only include screens that are actually used
3. WHEN navigation types are declared THEN the system SHALL only include routes that exist in the implementation
4. WHEN wrapper components exist THEN the system SHALL only include wrappers that serve a clear purpose
